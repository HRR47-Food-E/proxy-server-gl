# Food-E

> Food-E is an application for viewing restaurant listings. Each listing page has a photo gallery + carousel at the top, an information section, a sidebar showing opening hours and a map to their location, a section with tips and articles related to the restaurant, and a grid showing similar restaurants by category and neighborhood.
